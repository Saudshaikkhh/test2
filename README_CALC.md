# Simple Calculator

Files added:

- `index.html` — main UI file
- `styles.css` — styling
- `app.js` — calculator logic and keyboard support

How to use:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve from a simple static server).
2. Click buttons or use your keyboard (numbers, `+ - * / ( ) . %`, `Enter` for equals, `Backspace` to delete, `Esc` to clear).

Notes:

- The calculator evaluates simple arithmetic. Percent (`%`) is treated as division by 100 (e.g., `50%` → `0.5`).
- Input is validated to allow only numeric/operator characters before evaluation.
